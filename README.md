# First Semester of Systems Development

Welcome to the **First Semester of Systems Development** repository! This course covers both **front-end** and **back-end** aspects, as well as essential tools like GitHub for version control.

## Course Content

### 1. Front-end Fundamentals
- **UI/UX**: Introduction to the concepts of interface design and user experience, focusing on best practices for creating intuitive and accessible interfaces.
- **HTML**: Structuring web pages using HTML markup language to create accessible content.
- **CSS**: Styling pages with CSS to enhance layout, responsiveness, and visual appeal of applications.

### 2. Back-end Fundamentals
- **C#**:
    - **Decision Structures**: Utilizing conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`) to control the execution flow of the program.
    - **Loop Structures**: Implementing loops (`for`, `while`, `foreach`) for repeated operations based on conditions.
    - **Logic Programming**: Developing algorithms and problem-solving skills using logical reasoning techniques.
    - **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Principles of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction for organizing and modularizing code efficiently.

### 3. MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- Introduction to the **MVC** architecture pattern, which separates applications into three components: **Model** (data and logic), **View** (user interface), and **Controller** (flow control and interaction), allowing for better organization and maintainability of code.

### 4. GitHub
- Using **GitHub** for version control, collaborating on projects efficiently, tracking changes, and managing development with repositories, issues, pull requests, and branches.
